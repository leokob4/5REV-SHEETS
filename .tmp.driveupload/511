implement user registration and sheet edition
get tools and profile tab to be filled with values from sheets, hide based on user permission
also we will have a selection based right click or tool function execution, i'm thiking about it.
doing this we will validate all excel sheet links to build a universal sheet health checker
we need to implement user item creation somehow for each module in the new module file in github
(fix web frontent later)
